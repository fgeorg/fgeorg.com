<h1>Realtime Rigid Body Simulation</h1>

<h3>Francesco Georg</h3>

<p>
My goal is to create a simple rigid body physics engine that is packaged up and ready to use in a game.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>

While real-time rigid body physics engines tend to be less accurate they have the benefit that you can interact with them, making them ideal for video games.

<h2>Project Outline</h2>
<p>
The main challanges and components of the simulation are the following:
</p>
<pre>
- ODE solver
   - Given velocity and acceleration, what is the position?
- Collision and detection
   - Are the meshes intersecting? What is the normal of collision? Are the bodies moving toward or away from each other?
- Equations of Dynamics
   - Everything comes back to F=ma
   - Calculate impulses based on how the objects collide and their material properties
- Rendering
   - We want something real-time that clearly shows us what's going on
</pre>
<h2>ODE solver</h2>
<p>
I implemented a stupidly simple solver using euler's method. At each time step, I basically do the following:
</p>
<pre>
for each body b
  accel = (forces acting on b) / (mass of b)

  b.vel += accel * dt
  b.vel += (impulses acting on b) / (mass of b)

  b.pos += b.vel * dt
</pre>
<p>
I do something similar for rotational acceleration and velocity. I did some tests using smaller time step divisions to find that the quality of the simulation wasn't really affected by the ODE solver, so I didn't bother making it more complicated.
</p>

<h2>Collision Detection</h2>
<p>
Each body has a triangle mesh describing it's surface. To detect collisions between bodies b1 and b2, I check each edge in b1's mesh agaist each triangle in b2's mesh and vise versa. This gets very slow without any kind of acceleration structure, so I do some simple bounding box checking to avoid having to check every mesh against every other mesh.
</p>
<p>
For two intersecting bodies, I find every point of edge-triangle intersection. To find the normal for that collision, I take the least squares approximation for the closest plane to all points. The normal to that plane tends to be a pretty good normal for the collision.
</p>

<h2>Dynamics Equations</h2>
<p>
Now we have information telling us the point and normals of collision. To Find the impulses, I use an equation I found on a game developer's forum <a href="http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=186335">Calculating impulse due to rigid body collision with friction.</a>
</p>

<p>
This is the equation:
</p>
<pre>
jn = vn*(-(1 + e))
jn /= 1/m1 + 1/m2 + ( (I1_inv dot (R1 cross N)) cross R1) dot N + ( (I2_inv dot (R2 cross N)) cross R2) dot N

jn:                 the scalar impulse along the normal
vn:                 closing velocity of the bodies at the point of collision
e:                  the coefficient of restitution decribing how elastic the collision is
m1 and m2:          the mass of b1 and b2
I1_inv and I2_inv:  inverse of the inertia tensor for b1 and b2
R1 and R2:          the position vector from b's center of mass to the point of collision
N:                  The normal of the collision
</pre>
<p>
and similarly
</p>
<pre>
jt = vt
jt /= 1/m1 + 1/m2 + ( (I1_inv dot (R1 cross T)) cross R1) dot T + ( (I2_inv dot (R2 cross T)) cross R2) dot T
if (jt > jn*friction) then jt = jn*friction

jt:                 the scalar impulse along the tangent due to friction
vt:                 the speed along the tangent of the collision
T:                  the vector tangent of the collision
</pre>

<h2>Rendering</h2>
<p>
I keep the renderer separate from the physics library, but I wrote a simple OpenGL program that showcases the physics engine, with an option to show you collisions and bounding boxes.

<h2>Results</h2>

Here's video capture of a test using the psim library: <br/>
